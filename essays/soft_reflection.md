# Reflection on ICS 414

## Introduction
This semester, **ICS 414** provided an invaluable opportunity to deepen my understanding of software engineering principles with a more real-life application. The course focused on building robust web applications for Spire Hawaii, and the course encouraged hands-on experience, working with a customer, and teamwork, making me better prepared for real-world challenges.

## Key Learnings
Throughout the semester, we used tools like **React**, **Meteor**, and **MongoDB**, for modern web development. One of the highlights was collaborating with peers to build a seamless web application that integrated these tools. This project not only tested my technical skills but also enhanced my ability to work within a team dynamic and a customer. Debugging, adhering to coding standards, and managing tasks on GitHub were essential parts of the process. 

## Personal Growth
The journey wasnâ€™t without its hurdles. Initially, reading the Excel sheet felt tedious, and it felt like a lot of time was spent analyzing something outside of the scope of the class. But I quickly realized that this is an important part of working with a customer and asking for the information needed to do my job accurately is an essential part of meetings. Additionally, juggling team schedules and resolving merge conflicts during development pushed me to develop stronger communication and project management skills.

## Professional Impact
ICS 414 has significantly shaped my approach to coding and project management. It also prepared me for professional scenarios, where collaborative coding and agile methodologies are the norm. Adding the projects to my professional portfolio demonstrates my ability to tackle complex problems and build user-focused solutions.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, ICS 414 was an eye-opening experience that solidified my technical foundation and prepared me for future challenges. I look forward to applying these skills in my career, building on this strong base to grow as a software engineer.
