---

In this project, we focused on creating algorithms that can independently grasp the nuances of playing the board game Tigers and Goats. Through the use of machine learning techniques, our system learns strategies by closely observing gameplay, akin to how humans pick up on strategies through experience. We delve into machine learning, neural networks, and Large Language Models to understand the core principles. Python serves as our programming language of choice, and we explore tools like TensorFlow designed specifically for machine-learning applications. The ultimate objective is clear-cut: enabling automatic machine gameplay for the strategy game Tigers and Goats, aiming to bring a practical and descriptive approach to the world of artificial intelligence in gaming.
