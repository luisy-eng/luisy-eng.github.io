## **Overview**

This project is a short animated sequence designed and developed using Adobe Illustrator and Adobe After Effects. The goal was to explore motion design principles while creating a clean and engaging visual narrative using After Effects.

## **Tools Used**

- **Adobe Illustrator:** Used to create, design and layer animated assets.
- **Adobe After Effects:** Used for timeline animation, motion paths, easing, and final compositing.

## **Design Process**

1. **Concept & Storyboarding:**  
   I began by creating a prototype outline of sequence, visuals and movements that would communicate the story.
   After sketching all the story boards I placed them in Adobe Illustrator for sketching.

2. **Asset Creation in Illustrator:**  
   Graphical assets were built as clean, scalable vectors, with layered organization to make them animation-ready.

3. **Animation in After Effects:**  
   Using keyframes, position paths, and easing, I animated the components to create fluid motion while maintaining timing and visual interest.

## **Reflection**

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of how to bridge static design and motion graphics. Working across two tools taught me the importance of workflow planning and asset preparation.
